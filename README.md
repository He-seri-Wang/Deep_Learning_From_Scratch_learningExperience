replaced the original method of downloading MNIST from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ because I cannot load the files. Instead the scripts here loads from local MNIST .csv files provided. Uploaded here in case that anyone met the same problem.
please download the mnist_train.csv by urself cuz it's too large to upload here
